## OVERVIEW

In this Assignment, we move beyond the investigation of within-site $\alpha$-diversity.
We will explore $\beta$-diversity, which is defined as the diversity that occurs among sites.
This requires that we examine the compositional similarity of assemblages that vary in space or time.

After completing this exercise you will know how to:

1. formally quantify $\beta$-diversity
2. visualize $\beta$-diversity with heatmaps, cluster analysis, and ordination
3. test hypotheses about $\beta$-diversity using multivariate statistics

## Directions:
1. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
2. Complete as much of the exercise as possible during class; what you do not complete in class will need to be done on your own outside of class.
3. Use the Handout as a guide; it contains a more complete description of data sets along with the proper scripting needed to carry out the exercise.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this exercise document; they also correspond to the Handout.
Space for your answer is provided in this document and indicated by the ">" character.

5. Before you leave the classroom, **push** this file to your GitHub repo.
6. When you are done wit the Assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a html file.
7. After Knitting, please submit the completed Assignment by creating a **pull request** via GitHub.
Your pull request should include this file *beta_assignment.Rmd* and the html output of `Knitr` (*beta_assignment.html*).

## 1) R SETUP

Typically, the first thing you will do in either an R script or an RMarkdown file is setup your environment. 
This includes things such as setting the working directory and loading any packages that you will need.

In the R code chunk below, provide the code to:  

1. clear your R environment,
2. print your current working directory,
3. set your working directory to your "*/Week3-Beta*" folder, and
4. load the `vegan` R package (be sure to install if needed).  

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
getwd()
setwd("C:/Users/Savannah/GitHub/QB2017_Bennett/Week3-Beta")

```

## 2) LOADING DATA
### Load dataset
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. load the `doubs` dataset from the `ade4` package, and
2. explore the structure of the dataset.

```{r}

package.list <- c('vegan', 'ade4', 'viridis', 'gplots', 'BiodiversityR', 'indicspecies')
for (package in package.list) {
if (!require(package,character.only=T,quietly=T)) {
install.packages(package)
library(package,character.only=T)
}
}


data(doubs)
str(doubs,max.level =1)
head(doubs$env)
help(doubs)


```

***Question 1***:  Describe some of the attributes of the `doubs` dataset.  

a.  How many objects are in `doubs`?
b.  How many fish species are there in the `doubs` dataset?
c.  How many sites are in the `doubs` dataset?

> ***Answer 1a***:There are 4 objects in the dataset. 
> ***Answer 1b***:There are 27 fish species in the doubs dataset.
> ***Answer 1c***:There are 30 sites in this dataset. 

### Visualizing the Doubs River Dataset

***Question 2***: Answer the following questions based on the spatial patterns of richness (i.e., $\alpha$-diversity) and Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*) abundance in the Doubs River.  

a.  How does fish richness vary along the sampled reach of the Doubs River?
b.  How does Brown Trout (*Salmo trutta*) abundance vary along the sampled reach of the Doubs River?
c.  What do these patterns say about the limitations of using richness when examining patterns of biodiversity?

> ***Answer 2a***:Fish richness generally seems higher at the downstream site compared to the upstream site.   
> ***Answer 2b***:Brown Trout abundance seeems higher at the upstream site compared to the downstream site. 
> ***Answer 2c***:These patterns indicate that it is important to analyze species composition in addition to species richness. Richness alone should not be used to analyze diversity, because this metric may not be the best representation of the community or system (i.e. it may not accurately reflect community dynamics).

## 3) QUANTIFYING BETA-DIVERSITY

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. write a function (`beta.w()`) to calculate Whittaker's $\beta$-diversity (i.e., $\beta_{w}$) that accepts a site-by-species matrix with optional arguments to specify pairwise turnover between two sites, and
2. use this function to analyze various aspects of $\beta$-diversity in the Doubs River.  

```{r}

beta.w <-function(site.by.species =""){
SbyS.pa <- decostand(site.by.species,method ="pa") 
S <- ncol(SbyS.pa[,which(colSums(SbyS.pa) >0)]) 
a.bar <- mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa)) 
b.w <- round(S/a.bar,3) 
return(b.w)
}

beta.w2 = function(site.by.species = "", sitenum1 = "", sitenum2 = "", pairwise = FALSE){
  if (pairwise == TRUE){
    if (sitenum1 == "" | sitenum2 == "") {
      print("Error: please specify sites to compare") 
      return(NA)}
    site1 = site.by.species[sitenum1,]
    site2 = site.by.species[sitenum2,]

beta.w <- function(site.by.species = "") {
  SbyS.pa <- decostand(site.by.species, method = "pa")
  S <- ncol(SbyS.pa[, which(colSums(SbyS.pa) >0)])
  a.bar <- mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa))
  b.w <- round(S/a.bar, 3)
  return(b.w)
}

beta.w <- function(site.by.species = "", sitenum1 = "", sitenum2 = "", pairwise = FALSE) {
  if (pairwise == TRUE) {
    if (sitenum1 == "" | sitenum2 == "") {
      print("Error: please specify sites to compare")
      return(NA)}
    site1 = site.by.species [sitenum1,]
    site2 = site.by.species [sitenum2,]

    site1 = subset(site1, select = site1 > 0)
    site2 = subset(site2, select = site2 > 0)
    gamma = union(colnames(site1), colnames(site2))
    s = length(gamma)
    a.bar = mean(c(specnumber(site1), specnumber(site2)))

    b.w = round(s/a.bar - 1, 3)
    return(b.w)
  }
  else{
    SbyS.pa = decostand(site.by.species, method = "pa")
    S = ncol(SbyS.pa[,which(colSums(SbyS.pa) > 0)])
    a.bar = mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa))
    b.w = round(S/a.bar, 3)
    return(c(b.w,a.bar,S))
  }
}

beta.w2(doubs$fish)
beta.w2(doubs$fish, 1,2, pairwise=TRUE)
beta.w2(doubs$fish, 1,10, pairwise=TRUE)

    b.w. = round(s/a.bar - 1,3)
    return(b.w)
  }
  else{SbyS.pa} <- decostand(site.by.species, method ="pa")
  S <- ncol(Sbys.pa[,which(colSums(SbyS.pa) > 0)])
  a.bar <- mean(specnumber(SbyS.pa))
  b.w <- round(S/abar, 3)
  return(b.w)
}


beta.w(doubs$fish)






```

***Question 3***: Using your `beta.w()` function above, answer the following questions:

a.  Describe how local richness ($\alpha$) and turnover ($\beta$) contribute to regional ($\gamma$) fish diversity in the Doubs.
b.  Is the fish assemblage at site 1 more similar to the one at site 2 or site 10?
c.  Using your understanding of the equation $\beta_{w} = \gamma/\alpha$, how would your interpretation of $\beta$ change if we instead defined beta additively (i.e., $\beta = \gamma - \alpha$)?

> ***Answer 3a***:The turnover describes how many times higher the gamma diversity is than the alpha diversity. The relationship between these variables is multiplicative in that the gamma diversity is equal to the alpha diversity multiplied by the beta diversity. In this dataset, the beta diversity value indicates that the gamma diversity is about twice as much as the alpha diversity. Therefore, gamma diversity is 27.   
> ***Answer 3b***:Site 1 is more similar to site 2 than site 10 because the beta diversity value for these two sites is lower.  
> ***Answer 3c***:If beta was defined additively, it would no longer reflect how many times more diverse the regional species pool is than the local pool. The beta value for fish in this dataset would be about 14.5 instead of 12.5. Diversity among sites would therefore seem more similar. 

### The Resemblance Matrix
In order to quantify $\beta$-diversity for more than two samples, we need to introduce a new primary ecological data structure: the **Resemblance Matrix**. 

***Question 4***: How do incidence- and abundance-based metrics differ in their treatment of rare species?

> ***Answer 4***:The incidence based tests account for rare species more so than the abundance based tests. Unlike the incidence based metric, the abundance based metric simply sums the number of each species at each site, which causes the rate species to have less weight in determining similarity among separate sites.  

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. make a new object, `fish`, containing the fish abundance data for the Doubs River, 
2. remove any sites where no fish were observed (i.e., rows with sum of zero),
3. construct a resemblance matrix based on SÃ¸rensen's Similarity ("fish.ds"), and
4. construct a resemblance matrix based on Bray-Curtis Distance ("fish.db").  

```{r}
fish <-doubs$fish
fish <-fish[-8, ] # Remove site 8 from data
# Calculate Jaccard
fish.dj <- vegdist(fish,method ="jaccard",binary =TRUE)
# Calculate Bray-Curtis
fish.db <- vegdist(fish,method ="bray")
# Calculate Sørensen
fish.ds <- vegdist(fish,method ="bray",binary =TRUE)

fish.db

fish.db <- vegdist(fish,method ="bray",upper =TRUE,diag =TRUE)







```

***Question 5***: Using the distance matrices from above, answer the following questions:

a. Does the resemblance matrix (`fish.db`) represent similarity or dissimilarity? What information in the resemblance matrix led you to arrive at your answer? 
b. Compare the resemblance matrices (`fish.db` or `fish.ds`) you just created. How does the choice of the SÃ¸rensen or Bray-Curtis distance influence your interpretation of site (dis)similarity?

> ***Answer 5a***:The resemblance matrix represents dissimilarity. One can see that the resemblance matrix represents dissimilarity because the values comparing sites 1 and 2, and sites 1 and 10 were equal to the Whittaker's beta diversity values (which measured dissimilarity) for these sites.   
> ***Answer 5b***:The Sorensen index puts a greater emphasis on the number of shared species or the similarity of two sites compared to the Bray-Curtis index. In other words, the similariy could be inflated in the Sorensen index. 

## 4) VISUALIZING BETA-DIVERSITY

### A. Heatmaps

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. define a color palette,
2. define the order of sites in the Doubs River, and
3. use the `levelplot()` function to create a heatmap of fish abundances in the Doubs River.

```{r}
# Define Order of Sites
order <- rev(attr(fish.db,"Labels"))

# Plot Heatmap
levelplot(as.matrix(fish.db)[, order],aspect ="iso",col.regions =inferno,
xlab ="Doubs Site",ylab ="Doubs Site",scales = list(cex =0.5),
main ="Bray-Curtis Distance")


```

### B.  Cluster Analysis

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. perform a cluster analysis using Ward's Clustering, and
2. plot your cluster analysis (use either `hclust` or `heatmap.2`). 

```{r} 
# Perform Cluster Analysis
fish.ward <- hclust(fish.db,method ="ward.D2")

# Plot Cluster
par(mar = c(1,5,2,2) +0.1)
plot(fish.ward,main ="Doubs River Fish: Ward's Clustering",
ylab ="Squared Bray-Curtis Distance")

gplots::heatmap.2(as.matrix(fish),distfun =function(x) vegdist(x,method ="bray"),
hclustfun =function(x) hclust(x,method ="ward.D2"),
col =viridis,trace ="none",density.info ="none")

```

***Question 6***: Based on cluster analyses and the introductory plots that we generated after loading the data, develop an ecological hypothesis for fish diversity the `doubs` data set? 

> ***Answer 6***:The upstream sites have lower diversity and abundance compared to sites further downstream. Perhaps some environmental factor such as stream flow or the presence of a pollutant may have caused this difference. However, based on the data provided, one cannot discern the cause of this hypothesized difference in diversity and abundance. 

### C.  Ordination

### Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA)

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. perform a Principal Coordinates Analysis to visualize beta-diversity
2. calculate the variation explained by the first three axes in your ordination
3. plot the PCoA ordination,
4. label the sites as points using the Doubs River site number, and
5. identify influential species and add species coordinates to PCoA plot.

```{r}
fish.pcoa <- cmdscale(fish.db,eig =TRUE,k =3)

explainvar1 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[1] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig),3) *100
explainvar2 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[2] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig),3) *100
explainvar3 <- round(fish.pcoa$eig[3] / sum(fish.pcoa$eig),3) *100
sum.eig <- sum(explainvar1, explainvar2, explainvar3)

dev.off
# Define Plot Parameters
par(mar = c(5,5,1,2) +0.1)
# Initiate Plot
plot(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2],ylim = c(-0.2,0.7),
xlab = paste("PCoA 1 (", explainvar1,"%)",sep =""),
ylab = paste("PCoA 2 (", explainvar2,"%)",sep =""),
pch =16,cex =2.0,type ="n",cex.lab =1.5,cex.axis =1.2,axes =FALSE)
# Add Axes
axis(side =1,labels =T,lwd.ticks =2,cex.axis =1.2,las =1)
axis(side =2,labels =T,lwd.ticks =2,cex.axis =1.2,las =1)
abline(h =0,v =0,lty =3)
box(lwd =2)
# Add Points & Labels
points(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2],
pch =19,cex =3,bg ="gray",col ="gray")
text(fish.pcoa$points[ ,1], fish.pcoa$points[ ,2],
labels = row.names(fish.pcoa$points))

# Calculate the relative abundances of each species at each site
fishREL <-fish 
for(i in 1:nrow(fish)){
fishREL[i, ] =fish[i, ] / sum(fish[i, ])
}

# Calculate and add species scores
fish.pcoa <- add.spec.scores(fish.pcoa,fishREL,method ="pcoa.scores")
text(fish.pcoa$cproj[ ,1], fish.pcoa$cproj[ ,2],
labels = row.names(fish.pcoa$cproj),col ="black")




```

In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. identify influential species based on correlations along each PCoA axis (use a cutoff of 0.70), and
2. use a permutation test (999 permutations) to test the correlations of each species along each axis.

```{r}

spe.corr <- add.spec.scores(fish.pcoa, fishREL,method ="cor.scores")$cproj
corrcut <-0.7 # user defined cutoff
imp.spp <-spe.corr[abs(spe.corr[,1]) >=corrcut | abs(spe.corr[,2]) >=corrcut, ]
print(imp.spp)

# Permutation Test for Species Abundances Across Axes
fit <- envfit(fish.pcoa, fishREL,perm =999)
print(imp.spp)


```

***Question 7***: Address the following questions about the ordination results of the `doubs` data set:

a.  Describe the grouping of sites in the Doubs River based on fish community composition.
b.  Generate a hypothesis about which fish species are potential indicators of river quality.

> ***Answer 7a***:Based on the PCoA results, the downstream sites were clustered together, and the upstream sites were clustered together. 
> ***Answer 7b***:Phph, Neba, Rham, Legi, Cyca, Abbr, Acce, Blbj, Alal, Anan are potential indicators of water quality.  


## 5) HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### A.  Multivariate Procedures for Categorical Designs
Earlier work done in the Doubs River suggested that the river has four distinct regions of habitat quality: the first region (sites 1-14) of "high quality"; the second (sites 15 - 19) and fourth (sites 26 - 30) of "moderate quality"; and the third  (sites 20 - 25) of "low quality".

In the code chunk below, test the hypothesis that fish community composition varies with river quality.

1. create a factor vector that categorizes habitat quality in the Doubs River,
2. use the multivariate analyses for categorical predictors to describe how fish community structure relates to habitat quality.

```{r}
# Create "Factors" vector
quality <- c(rep("HQ",13), rep("MQ",5), rep("LQ",6), rep("MQ",5))

# Run PERMANOVA with adonis function
adonis(fish ~quality,method ="bray",permutations =999)

#IndVal Scores 
indval <- multipatt(fish,cluster =quality,func ="IndVal.g",control = how(nperm=999))
summary(indval)

#Phi Coefficient of Association
fish.rel <- decostand(fish,method ="total")
phi <- multipatt(fish.rel,cluster =quality,func ="r.g",control = how(nperm=999))
summary(phi)


```

***Question 8***: Based on the PERMANOVA, IndVal, and phi coefficient analyses, what did you learn about the relationship between habitat quality and the fish species composition?

> ***Answer 8***: The PERMANOVA indicates that community composition varies significantly with water quality. The IndVal test suggests that Teso is an indicator species for the medium quality region, and Satr and Phph are indicator species of the high and middle water quality regions. Further, Alal, Gogo, Ruru, Legi, Baba, Chna, Spbi, Cyca, Acce, Lele, Titi, Chto, Rham, Anan, Eslu, Pefl, Blbj, Scer, Abbr, and Icme are indicators for the low and medium water quality regions. In other words, this analysis provided indicator species for each region. 
>Similarly, the phi coefficient analysis indicates that Phph, Neba, and Satr have a strong preference for the high quality region. Alal and Ruru have a strong preference for the low quality region, and Anan, Spbi, Chto, and Icme have a strong preference for the medium quality region. Overall, these analyses are suggesting that fish species composition depends on water quality. 


### B.  Multivariate Procedures for Continuous Designs

### i.  Mantel Test
In the R code chunk below, do the following:   

1. create distance matrices for both fish communities and environmental factors, and
2. use a Mantel test to determine if these matrices are correlated, and test the hypothesis that fish assemblages are correlated with stream environmental variables.

```{r}
# Define Matrices
fish.dist <- vegdist(doubs$fish[-8, ],method ="bray")
env.dist <- vegdist(scale(doubs$env[-8,]),method ="euclid")

#Mantel Test
mantel(fish.dist,env.dist)




```

***Question 9***: What do the results from our Mantel test suggest about fish diversity and stream environmental conditions? How does this relate to your hypothesis about stream quality influencing fish communities?

> ***Answer 9***:The Mantel test suggests that fish diversity is significantly correlated with stream environmental variables, which supports the hypothesis that stream quality influences fish communities.   

### ii.  Constrained Ordination
In the R code chunk below, do the following:  

1. create an environmental matrix of the water chemistry data included in the `doubs` dataset using forward and reverse selection of variables,
2. conduct a redundancy analysis on the fish assemblages of the Doubs River,
3. use a permutation test to determine the significance of the constrained analysis,
4. use a permutation test to determine the correlation of each environmental factor on the constrained axes,
5. calculate the explained variation on the first and second constrained axes,
6. plot the constrained ordination results including labeled points for each site, and
7. add vectors that demonstrate the influence of each environmental factor the constrained ordination.   

```{r}
# Define environmental matrix
env.chem <- as.matrix(doubs$env[-8,5:11])

# Perform dbRDA
doubs.dbrda <- dbrda(fish.db ~., as.data.frame(env.chem))
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda)

# Model the intercept
doubs.dbrda.mod0 <- dbrda(fish.db ~1, as.data.frame(env.chem))
# Note there are no vectors here (we didn't constrain anything)
# Therefore, the axes suggest this is a simple MDS (i.e., PCoA)
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda.mod0)

# Model the full model, with all explanatory variables
doubs.dbrda.mod1 <- dbrda(fish.db ~., as.data.frame(env.chem))

# Step through all combinations of explanatory variables in our model
# The function returns the model with the lowest AIC value
doubs.dbrda <- ordiR2step(doubs.dbrda.mod0, doubs.dbrda.mod1,perm.max =200)


doubs.dbrda$call
doubs.dbrda$anova
ordiplot(doubs.dbrda)

# Permutation tests to evaluate significance
permutest(doubs.dbrda,permutations =999)
envfit(doubs.dbrda, env.chem[,c(4,6,7)],perm =999)

# Calculate Explained Variation
dbrda.explainvar1 <- round(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig[1] /
sum(c(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig, doubs.dbrda$CA$eig)),3) *100
dbrda.explainvar2 <- round(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig[2] /
sum(c(doubs.dbrda$CCA$eig, doubs.dbrda$CA$eig)),3) *100

#Plot the ordination for the selected model.

# Define Plot Parameters
par(mar = c(5,5,4,4) +0.1)

# Initiate Plot
plot(scores(doubs.dbrda,display ="wa"),xlim = c(-1.3,1.1),ylim = c(-1.1,2.7),
xlab = paste("dbRDA 1 (", dbrda.explainvar1,"%)",sep =""),
ylab = paste("dbRDA 2 (", dbrda.explainvar2,"%)",sep =""),
pch =16,cex =2.0,type ="n",cex.lab =1.5,cex.axis =1.2,axes =FALSE)

# Add Axes
axis(side =1,labels =T,lwd.ticks =2,cex.axis =1.2,las =1)
axis(side =2,labels =T,lwd.ticks =2,cex.axis =1.2,las =1)
abline(h =0,v =0,lty =3)
box(lwd =2)

# Add Points & Labels
points(scores(doubs.dbrda,display ="wa"),
pch =19,cex =3,bg ="gray",col ="gray")
text(scores(doubs.dbrda,display ="wa"),
labels = row.names(scores(doubs.dbrda,display ="wa")))

# Add Environmental Vectors
vectors <- scores(doubs.dbrda,display ="bp")

#row.names(vectors) <- rownames(vectors)
arrows(0,0, vectors[,1], vectors[,2],
lwd =2,lty =1,length =0.2,col ="red")
text(vectors[,1], vectors[,2],pos =3,
labels = row.names(vectors))
axis(side =3,lwd.ticks=2,cex.axis=1.2,las =1,col ="red",lwd =2.2,
at = pretty(range(vectors[,1])) *2,labels = pretty(range(vectors[,1])))
axis(side =4,lwd.ticks=2,cex.axis=1.2,las =1,col ="red",lwd =2.2,
at = pretty(range(vectors[,2])) *2,labels = pretty(range(vectors[,2])))



```

***Question 10***: Based on the constrained ordination, what are the environmental variables (or groups of correlated variables) that seem to be contributing to variation in fish community structure?

> ***Answer 10***: Oxygen, bdo, and nitrogen appear to contribute to variation in fish community structure according to the constrained ordination. 

### iii. Variation Partitioning
In the code chunk below,   

1. Create a matrix model of the selected environmental variables,
2. Create a matrix model of the selected PCNM axes,
3. Perform constrained and partial constrained ordinations using the spatial and environmental models you just created,
4. Test the significance of each of your constrained ordinations using permutation tests,
5. Partition the variation among sites into the relative importance of space, environment, spatially structured environment, and residuals,
6. Plot the variation partitioning output to visualize it.  
```{r}
# Remember, our environmental model uses oxy, bdo, and nit and has R2 of 0.53
doubs.dbrda$anova

# Let's create a matrix model for our environmental data
env.mod <- model.matrix(~oxy +bdo +nit, as.data.frame(env.chem))[,-1]

# Weight each site by its relative abundance
rs <- rowSums(fish)/sum(fish)

# Perform PCNM
doubs.pcnmw <- pcnm(dist(doubs$xy[-8,]),w =rs,dist.ret =T)
# PCNM can return negative eigenvalues, but only the
# eigenvectors associated with the positive eigenvalues are meaningful
doubs.pcnmw$values >0

doubs.space <- as.data.frame(scores(doubs.pcnmw))
doubs.pcnm.mod0 <- dbrda(fish.db ~1, doubs.space)
doubs.pcnm.mod1 <- dbrda(fish.db ~., doubs.space)
step.pcnm <- ordiR2step(doubs.pcnm.mod0, doubs.pcnm.mod1,perm.max =200)
# Because this is another dbRDA, we could visualize the biplot
# showing how each vector explains variation across sites

plot(step.pcnm)

# The object `step.pcnm` now contains the selected model.
step.pcnm$anova

# Construct a spatial model using only the selected PCNM axes.
space.mod <- model.matrix(~PCNM2 +PCNM3 +PCNM5 +PCNM1 +
PCNM13 +PCNM16 +PCNM6, doubs.space)[,-1]

# Conduct constrained ordinations
doubs.total.env <- dbrda(fish.db ~env.mod)
doubs.total.space <- dbrda(fish.db ~space.mod)

# Construct partial constrained ordinations
doubs.env.cond.space <- dbrda(fish.db ~env.mod + Condition(space.mod))
doubs.space.cond.env <- dbrda(fish.db ~space.mod + Condition(env.mod))

# Test for significance of the dbRDA fractions.
permutest(doubs.env.cond.space,permutations =999)
permutest(doubs.space.cond.env,permutations =999)
permutest(doubs.total.env,permutations =999)

permutest(doubs.total.space,permutations =999)

# Using the built-in varpart() function
doubs.varpart <- varpart(fish.db, env.mod, space.mod)
doubs.varpart
par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))
plot(doubs.varpart)
text(1,0.25,"Space")
text(0,0.25,"Env")
mtext("Variation Partitioning of\nDoubs Fish Diversity",side =3,line =-3)

```

***Question 11***: Interpret the variation partitioning results.   

> ***Answer 11***: 13% of the variation in diversity by site can be attributed to the environment, or unique environmental variation. 37% of the variation in fish diversity can be attributed to space and the environment, or spacially structured environmental variation. Further, 24% of the variation in diverstiy can be attributed to space, or unique spatial variation. 

## SYNTHESIS
Load the dataset you are using for your project. Perform an ordination to visualize your dataset.  Using this ordination, develop some hypotheses relevant to $\beta$-diversity and identify the appropriate tools you would use to test them.

>The Bray-Curtis index would be an appropriate test for our dataset because it has relative abundances of endophyte OTUs at each sampling site. This ordination plot (Bray-Curtis index version) shows most of the points clustered in the middle of the plot. There do not appear to be other groupings of data points on this plot aside from several points towards the bottom of the plot, and several in the top left. The x and y axes of this plot only account for 11.5% and 9% of the variation in the data. Overall, it is difficult to discern whether there are any patterns based on this plot because the points are all clustered together in the middle of the plot.

>Although the Bray-Curtis index version of the ordination plot seems to be a better fit for our dataset (because it measures relative abundances), I did the Sorensen version as well to see whether any different patterns would arise. However, similar to the other ordination plot, most of the points are clustered in the center of the plot again. The x and y axes on this plot explain 17.5% and 10.3% of the variation in the data, which is greater than that of the first plot.The first plot cut off part of the species name in the top left corner, but it seems that the same species are represented in the top left corner of each plot (Piloderma sphaerosporum).Perhaps other patterns would be visible if it was easier to read the species in the center. Also, it would be helpful to visualize the sites or site numbers on this plot. 

>Based on these ordination plots, it is difficult to develop hypotheses about beta diversity for this data set. Broadly, I hypothesize there will be high beta diversity among communities in different geographic regions. Beta diversity among the different tree species will also be high. In other words, diversity will differ among separate geographic locations and among tree species studied. Analyses and visualizations of beta diversity would test this hypothesis. Data on environmental variables would enable additional tests to be performed, but such data were not included in this data set. 

>I did the cluster analysis for both the Bray-Curtis index and Sorensen index analyses to visualize any potential similarities or differences in diversity by site.

>Based on the figures above, it is difficult to discern whether certain groups appear to be clustered together. Is there a way to make the sites more visible, or reduce the overlap of the sites on this figure? Looking at the cluster analysis from the Bray-Curtis index, the sites clustered together on the far left seem to be from one or two sites because it looks as if the numbers range from 10-20 (which refer to sites from Pinus Contorta in the USA). The sites on the far right seem to include sites 40-50, which include the European Pinus Contorta sites. However, further analyses are needed to determine whether diversity differs among the different geographic locations, and among the three species investigated. Using the Mantel test or a constrained ordination might be helpful in explaining beta diversity, but these data were not available in our dataset. 

>I also thought it might be interesting to examine beta diversity with respect to fungal functional groups (saprotrophs, EMF, parasites, and unknowns). Our dataset has relative abundances for each functional group. Perhaps analyzing beta diversity in terms of functional groups might yield new insights into differences among the different sites and tree species in this study. In the R-chunk below, I redid the ordination plots with the relative abundances of the functional groups at each site.
